# Starter code Password Generator for API

## A fully functional example project to show how to generate passwords for API

This project was an example that was built to showcase how to create a custom password for API's
using acceptance criteria options such as special characters, numbers, uppercase, and lowercase
combinations. Every part of this example is showcases how to do the following:

* Create a fully functional custom password generator for API's
* Create acceptance criteria options for the user
* Create an array for special characters, numbers, upper, lowercase letters, and length.
* Create a prompt for each acceptance criteria options, and automatically build and push.



 As a Web developer I was giving the task to generate a password that meets all acceptance criteria
 for the user in API's. I was able to do so while preforming a series of tasks and this code is provided 
 with explanations for other yours that may benefit. I first created variables with special characters, 
 numbers, length, uppercase, lowercase letters, and combination. to connect to an array. Then carried out 
 the function using const generatePassword. I then added all connecting elements and links to HTML. Afterwords
 I checked the HTML on Live Server and submitted there password generator button to make sure everything
 was running properly and fully functional.
